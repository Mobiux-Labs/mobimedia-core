# @mobimedia/core

Optimize your images on the fly with MobiMedia.ai. This is a SDK for converting and appending image optimization parameters to the image src making it optimized as per the client devices.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @mobimedia/core
```

## Usage for S3

```js
import { MobiMediaConfig } from "@mobimedia/core";

const s3Transformer = MobiMediaConfig("test.mobimedia.ai")
const src = s3Transformer.url("https://s3HostedMedia.mydomain.com/test.png", {
  w: 100,
});
// => https://test.mobimedia.ai/test.png?quality=70&format=webp&w=100
```

## Usage for Cloudinary URL Conversion to S3

```js
import { MobiMediaConfig } from "@mobimedia/core";

const s3 = MobiMediaConfig('test.mobimedia.ai', {
  s3PublicUrl: 'https://s3HostedMedia.mydomain.com',
  s3CloudinaryPath: '/cloudinary/res/cloudName/image/upload',
});

const src = s3.url(
  'https://cloudinaryHostedMedia.mydomain.com/cloudName/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,g_auto,w_640/v1674128459/test/test.jpg',
  {
    w: 100,
  }
);
// => https://test.mobimedia.ai/cloudinary/res/cloudName/image/upload/test/test/1674128459.jpg?quality=70&format=webp&w=100
```

## `MobiMediaConfig` Options

The `MobiMediaConfig` function provides options for configuring the MobiMedia.ai image optimization service. It takes the following parameters:

### `subDomain` (required)

Type: `string`

The `subDomain` parameter is a required string that represents the subdomain of the MobiMedia.ai service. This is a crucial configuration as it defines the specific MobiMedia.ai instance to be used for image optimization.

### `convertCloudinaryToS3Url` (optional)

Type: `{ s3PublicUrl: string, s3CloudinaryPath: string }`

Default: `{ s3PublicUrl: '', s3CloudinaryPath: '' }`

The `convertCloudinaryToS3Url` parameter is an optional object that allows configuring settings related to converting Cloudinary URLs to S3 URLs. It has the following properties:

* `s3PublicUrl`: A string representing the public URL of the S3 bucket where the images will be stored.

* `s3CloudinaryPath`: A string representing the path within the S3 bucket where the converted images will be stored.

## Image `url` Supported Options

| URL Arg | Type | Description |
|---|----|---|
|`w`|Number|Max width of the image.|
|`h`|Number|Max height of the image.|
|`quality`|Number, 0-100|Image quality.|
|`resize`|String, "w,h"|A comma separated string of the target width and height in pixels. Crops the image.|
|`crop_strategy`|String, "smart", "entropy", "attention"|There are 3 automatic cropping strategies for use with `resize`: <ul><li>`attention`: good results, ~70% slower</li><li>`entropy`: mediocre results, ~30% slower</li><li>`smart`: best results, ~50% slower</li>|
|`gravity`|String|Alternative to `crop_strategy`. Crops are made from the center of the image by default, passing one of "north", "northeast", "east", "southeast", "south", "southwest", "west", "northwest" or "center" will crop from that edge.|
|`fit`|String, "w,h"|A comma separated string of the target maximum width and height. Does not crop the image.|
|`crop`|Boolean\|String, "x,y,w,h"|Crop an image by percentages x-offset, y-offset, width and height (x,y,w,h). Percentages are used so that you donâ€™t need to recalculate the cropping when transforming the image in other ways such as resizing it. You can crop by pixel values too by appending `px` to the values. `crop=160px,160px,788px,788px` takes a 788 by 788 pixel square starting at 160 by 160.|
|`zoom`|Number|Zooms the image by the specified amount for high DPI displays. `zoom=2` produces an image twice the size specified in `w`, `h`, `fit` or `resize`. The quality is automatically reduced to keep file sizes roughly equivalent to the non-zoomed image unless the `quality` argument is passed.|
|`webp`|Boolean, 1|Load WebP format.|
|`lb`|String, "w,h"|Add letterboxing effect to images, by scaling them to width, height while maintaining the aspect ratio and filling the rest with black or `background`.|
|`background`|String|Add background color via name (red) or hex value (%23ff0000). Don't forget to escape # as `%23`.|
